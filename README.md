# Ant-Sim-Go
This is an Ant Colony Simulation I've been working on building on my local machine for a couple weeks now. I decided to put my spaghetti code for it on GitHub.

I had a lot of trouble with getting the pheromone paths to decay properly, and even more trouble getting the food pheromone paths to follow the other pheromone paths left behind already.
